Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Gatt Client
===================================

Code derived from Google Android Developers Example how to use the Bluetooth LE Generic Attribute Profile (GATT)
to transmit arbitrary data between devices.

Introduction
------------

Initial code used to receive Heart Rate Measurement service, changed to "Environmental Sensing".
Both terms may appear in the code but refer to the "main" service.

It creates a [Service][1] for managing connection and data communication with a GATT server
hosted on a given Bluetooth LE device.

The Activities communicate with the Service, which in turn interacts with the [Bluetooth LE API][2].
